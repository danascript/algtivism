## Algtivism

Algtivism is a social project aimed to storm the search results of search engines by normalizing inclusion and diversity. Feel free to fork it but use it responsibly.

To make it easier, I've set up all you need in order to have a basic running website and documented some steps/guide as to what to change (if you want to), where and how to find things.

OR Watch it on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24zFySpnBP4)!

### Content of choice

You are free to use any content you wish (don't forget to check for copyrights!) but here are some tips/suggestions:

#### Meta tags 

_**TIP**_: type in the search engine the term the results of which you wish to change (e.g. professional hairstyles), navigate to an example of your choice, click on the page to get the dropdown menu (right/left click on the mouse depending on your preferences) and choose ```View Page Source```. Now press ```Command + F``` or ```Ctrl + F``` and search for ```title``` and then ```description``` and here you go! All the information you need.

##### Titles

- Professional Hairstyles
- Hairstyles for Interviews
- Workplace hairstyles
- Hairstyles 2000 - 2020
- Best Job Appropriate Hairstyles
- Interview Appropriate Hairstyles

#### Images and Fonts

I found the current content on [Pexels](pexels.com) and the font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Always check for copyrights of images/fonts/anything else you're taking from the web! 

For better SEO I highly recommend you to optimise the images (in Pexels you can already get them in the size you need) and run them through an optimising service (I use [Panda](https://tinypng.com/)).
